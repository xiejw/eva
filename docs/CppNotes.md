**_Issue_: `warning: ISO C++11 does not allow conversion from string literal to 'char *const'`**

This error is generated by `clang` for the following global constant variable.

    constexpr char* kEvaPath = "~/Workspace/eva";

There were two questions in my mind for this warning.

1. What's the expected type for string literal in c++11?
2. What's the role of `constexpr`?

The answers are:

- `constexpr char*` is a `char* const`. The `constexpr` specifier applies to the
  whole type of the object -that is, it applies to the declaration.

  This is why the warning message mentioned `char *const`, as this is what the
  compiler sees.

- For c++11, the string literal has type `const char*` instead of `char*`
  (c-style).

Fixes:

    // either should work.
    constexpr char const* kEvaPath = "~/Workspace/eva";
    constexpr const char* kEvaPath = "~/Workspace/eva";
